            <p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conway's_Game_of_Life">Conway's Game of Life</a> is a cellular automaton devised by the British mathematician John Horton Conway in 1970.</p>
            <p>The game is represented by a grid of cells, each of which can be either "alive" or "dead". The grid is given an initial state and updates at a fixed rate. The next generation of the grid is determined by assigning new values to each cell based on the states of each cell's surrounding cells (its "neighbors").</p>
            <ul>
              <li>Any live cell with fewer than two live neighbors dies, as if by underpopulation.</li>
              <li>Any live cell with two or three live neighbors lives on to the next generation.</li>
              <li>Any live cell with more than three live neighbors dies, as if by overpopulation.</li>
              <li>Any dead cell with exactly three live neighbors becomes a live cell, as if by reproduction.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>In this implementation, you can set up the initial grid, start and stop the progression of time at any point, and interact with the grid while it's running.</p>
      
            <h2>Instructions</h2>
            <ul>
              <li>Set up the initial state of the grid by <strong>left-</strong> or <strong>right-clicking</strong> in the grid below, or clicking the <strong>"Randomize"</strong> button</li>
              <ul>
                <li>Left-click to mark cell as "alive"</li>
                <li>Right-click to mark cell as "dead"</li>
              </ul>
              <li>Press the <strong>"Start"</strong> button to begin the simulation</li>
              <ul>
                <li>Press the <strong>"Stop"</strong> button to pause the simulation at any time</li>
              </ul>
              <li>Press the <strong>"Clear"</strong> button to mark all cells as "dead"</li>
            </ul>
